# common-contracts (@rfx/common-contracts)

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Build

Run `pnpm nx build common-contracts` to build this library.

Note that `package.json` intentionally omits `main` and `module` fields so they are added by Nx (via esbuild) during build. The build configuration depends on `"generatePackageJson": true` and  `"format": ["cjs", "esm"]` in `project.json`.

Tree-shaking is enabled via `sideEffects: none` in `package.json`.

## Tests

Run `pnpm nx test common-contracts` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
