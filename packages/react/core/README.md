# react-core (@rfx/react-core)

Reusable components and hooks for use in React apps.

Styled with tailwindcss.

This library does not presently have its own tailwind or postcss configuration so it requires consuming apps to provide these. A full configuration must be added if this library is to be published or used in a standalone scenario.

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Unit Tests

Run `pnpm nx test react-core` to execute the unit tests via [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).
